# SQL-QUERIES-FOR-INCOME-RECONCILIATION-FOR-NHS-CONTRACTS

â€¢ Objective: Reconcile actual payments received with the expected income from NHS
contracts.
The goal of this project is to streamline the reconciliation process between expected and actual
payments from NHS contracts. By identifying discrepancies such as overpayments or
underpayments, this project helps ensure that financial records are accurate and that any
deviations from expected income are swiftly addressed.
Using SQL queries, the project demonstrates key techniques for detecting discrepancies,
classifying payment status, and analyzing patterns in contract payments. This is critical for
maintaining financial accountability and providing insights into NHS contract performance. Each
query is designed to highlight potential issues and assist in the reconciliation process efficiently
